        <h4>        Lyrics</h4>
        Can I call you baby?
        Can you be my friend?
        Can you be my lover up until the very end?
        Let me show you love, oh, I don't pretend
        Stick by my side even when the world is givin' in, yeah
        Oh, oh, oh, don't
        Don't you worry
        I'll be there, whenever you want me

        I need somebody who can love me at my worst
        No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
        'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
        And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

        If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
        I can fill those places in your heart no else can
        Let me show you love, oh, no pretend, yeah
        I'll be right here, baby, you know it's sink or swim

        Oh, oh, oh, don't
        Don't you worry
        I'll be there, whenever you want me

        I need somebody who can love me at my worst
        No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth, yeah
        'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first (you first)
        And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
        
        I need somebody who can love me at my worst
        No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
        'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
        And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
